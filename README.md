## Usage

To enable the Lightning Flow Scanner in your workflow, create a file named `.github/workflows/lightning-flow-scanner.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/scan-flows.yml
name: Scan Flows

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Flow Scanner
        id: scanner
        uses: ./  # ← This uses your local action (for testing with `act`)
        with:
          outputMode: sarif

      - name: Show SARIF file
        run: |
          SARIF_PATH="${{ steps.scanner.outputs.sarifPath }}"
          echo "SARIF Path: $SARIF_PATH"
          if [ -f "$SARIF_PATH" ]; then
            echo "File exists! Size: $(stat -c%s "$SARIF_PATH") bytes"
            echo "=== First 20 lines ==="
            head -20 "$SARIF_PATH"
            echo "=== End ==="
          else
            echo "File NOT found!"
          fi

      - name: Upload SARIF to Code Scanning
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ steps.scanner.outputs.sarifPath }}
```
To run the action you must also:

1. **Create a secrets file**:
- Add a secrets file at the repository root(`.secrets` is recommended).
- Include the following key-value pair: `GITHUB_TOKEN=<personal-access-token>`. 
  > Replace `<personal-access-token>` with a valid _GitHub Personal Access Token_(PAT) with appropriate permissions (`repo`, `workflow` scopes).

2. **Configure repository permissions**:
- Navigate to _Repository Settings > Actions > General_.
- Under _Workflow permissions_, select:
- _Read and write permissions_.

3. **Enable pull request creation and approval**:
- In the same _Actions > General_ settings page:
- Check _Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests_

**Privacy:** Zero user data collected. All processing is client-side.

### Run On Pull Requests

`on:pull_request` will trigger Flow Scanner to scan changed flow files every time a pull request is opened.

### Run As Manual Action

`on:workflow_dispatch` allows you to run the action on all Flows manually, by following these steps:
    1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
    2. Click on "Run Flow Scanner" in the list of available workflows.
    3. Press the "Run workflow" button to trigger the action.

## Configuration

It is recommended to set up a `.flow-scanner.yml` and define:

- The rules to be executed.
- The severity of violating any specific rule.
- Rule properties such as REGEX expressions.
- Any known exceptions that should be ignored during scanning.

### Scanner Options

```json
{
  "rules": {
    // Your rules here
  },
  "exceptions": {
    // Your exceptions here
  },
  "betamode": false // Enable beta rules
}
```

Using the rules section of your configurations, you can specify the list of rules to be run. Furthermore, you can define the severity and configure expressions of rules.  Below is a breakdown of the available attributes of rule configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "<RuleName>": {
      "severity": "<Severity>",
      "expression": "<Expression>"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: if you prefer JSON format, you can create a `.flow-scanner.json` file using the same format. For a more on configurations, review the [scanner documentation](https://flow-scanner.github.io/lightning-flow-scanner-core/#configuration).

## Development

To debug the action you need to:

- _Install [`ncc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/ncc) for compilation. On MacOs/ Unix run:_
```bash
npm i -g @vercel/ncc
```

- _Install [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/) and [`act`](https://nektosact.com/installation/index.html) to run GitHub Actions locally. On MacOs/ Unix run:_
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash 
```

1. Compile a new version
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Test the workflows locally:

```bash
act workflow_dispatch --secret-file .secrets
```
